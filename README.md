## `Accuracy Improvement of Neural Network Training using Particle Swarm Optimization and its Stability Analysis for Classification`

`ABSTRACT`

Supervised classification is the most active and emerging research trends in todayâ€™s scenario. In this view, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques have been widely employed and growing interest to the researchers day by day. ANN training aims to find the proper setting of parameters such as
weights (W) and biases (b) to properly classify the given data samples. The training process is formulated in an error minimization problem which consists of many local optima in the search landscape. In this paper, an enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization is proposed to minimize the error function
for classifying real-life data sets. A stability analysis is performed to establish the efficiency of the proposed method for improving classification accuracy. The performance measurement such as confusion matrix, F-measure and convergence graph indicates the significant improvement in the classification accuracy.
